## About Me
Hi, my name is Ruiqi Lai. I am a data enthusiast with skills in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning. This portfolio contains my Data Science, analysis, and visualization projects.
I completed all of the projects for self-learning, academic, and personal interest. Most of the projects in this portfolio were created by Jupyter Notebooks.
